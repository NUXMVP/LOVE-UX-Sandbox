# $LOVE – UX Sandbox

A calm space to explore how people understand, trust, and interact with digital value.

This repository is a **focused UX sandbox** for studying how thoughtful product design can make on-chain value feel simple, safe, and intuitive. It is not a product launch or token initiative — it is a **design research environment** used to test interaction patterns, language, and mental models for the future of digital value.

---

## Why this exists

Most on-chain experiences still feel unfamiliar or unsafe to everyday users. Even experienced users can feel uncertainty when interacting with digital value.

This sandbox explores how **clarity, language, and trust-forward interfaces** can help people feel more confident when taking on-chain actions.

The goal is to learn what makes digital value:

- Easy to understand at a glance  
- Comfortable and safe to interact with  
- Grounded in trust, even for new users

## What’s inside

This repo contains small, intentionally scoped UX experiments, including:

### On-Chain Interaction Prototype (Experimental)

A working (experimental) on-chain prototype enabling a real swap flow using Base + Uniswap routing.  
It is designed to observe how users behave during a high-trust interaction, and to study:

- Safety signaling and comprehension  
- Decision-making during value exchange  
- Reducing cognitive friction in on-chain flows  

The purpose is not to “ship a product,” but to **learn how people think and feel** when moving value on-chain — and explore how UX can make the experience calmer, clearer, and more trustworthy.

### Additional UX explorations

- Mental models for holding vs. using digital value  
- Language patterns that reduce anxiety or confusion  
- Visual design elements that support trust and clarity  
- Interaction flows that feel familiar to non-crypto users  

Each idea lives in its own branch, allowing exploration without pressure to converge.

The future of digital value will require more than infrastructure — it will need **interfaces that people trust without needing to understand the underlying mechanics**.

This sandbox is a step toward that future: exploring how to make interacting with value as natural as sending a message, tapping a card, or sharing a file.
